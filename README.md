# Resume

My resume created using Typst and the [basic-typst-resume-template](https://github.com/stuxf/basic-typst-resume-template).

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Install Typst:
   ```bash
   # For Linux/macOS
   curl -fsSL https://typst.app/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. Install VSCode:
   - Download from [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
   - Install the [TinyMist](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=myriad-dreamin.tinymist) extension for Typst support in VSCode

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

This resume is created using:
- [Typst](https://typst.app/) for typesetting
- Based on the [basic-typst-resume-template](https://github.com/stuxf/basic-typst-resume-template) (version 0.2.4)
- Using version 0.2.4 of the template as the preview functionality doesn't work in newer versions

## üìù Resume Generation

The project includes a bash script (`scripts/generate_resumes.sh`) that helps generate and distribute resumes with custom email addresses and optional phone numbers. The script can also send the generated resumes via Telegram.

### Usage

```bash
./scripts/generate_resumes.sh [-t] [-e "email1@domain.com,email2@domain.com"] [-p ["1234567890"]] [-b "bot_token"] [-c "chat_id"]
```

### Options

- `-t`: Enable Telegram sending
- `-e`: Comma-separated list of email addresses (optional)
- `-p`: Phone number (optional, can be empty)
- `-b`: Telegram bot token (optional if TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN env var is set)
- `-c`: Telegram chat ID (optional if TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID env var is set)

### Environment Variables

You can set the following environment variables instead of using command-line arguments:
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`: Your Telegram bot token
- `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`: Your Telegram chat ID

### Examples

1. Generate a single resume without email:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/generate_resumes.sh
   ```

2. Generate resumes for multiple email addresses:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/generate_resumes.sh -e "john@example.com,jane@example.com"
   ```

3. Generate resume with phone number:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/generate_resumes.sh -p "1234567890"
   ```

4. Generate and send via Telegram:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/generate_resumes.sh -t -e "john@example.com" -b "your_bot_token" -c "your_chat_id"
   ```

The script will generate PDF files in the `dist/` directory:
- For email-specific resumes: `dist/resume_username.pdf`
- For the default resume: `dist/resume.pdf`

When Telegram sending is enabled, it will send the generated files with a caption including the generation date.

## ü§ñ GitHub Actions & Automation

This repository uses GitHub Actions for automated resume generation. Here's how to set it up and use it:

### Configuration

To use the GitHub Actions workflows, you need to set up the following secrets in your repository:

1. `RESUME_EMAILS`: Comma-separated list of email addresses to generate resumes for (optional)
2. `PHONE`: Phone number to include in the resume (optional)
3. `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`: Your Telegram bot token (required if sending to Telegram)
4. `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`: Your Telegram chat ID (required if sending to Telegram)

To add these secrets:
1. Go to your repository settings
2. Navigate to "Secrets and variables" ‚Üí "Actions"
3. Click "New repository variable"
4. Add each secret with its corresponding value

### Available Workflows

The repository includes two automated workflows:

#### 1. Push-Based PDF Generation
Located in `.github/workflows/build-pdf-push.yml`, this workflow:
- Triggers automatically when changes are pushed to `src/main.typ`
- Can also be triggered manually via workflow dispatch
- Builds the resume using Typst
- Uploads the generated PDFs as artifacts with a retention period of 30 days
- Artifacts are named with the short SHA of the commit

#### 2. Manual PDF Release
Located in `.github/workflows/release.yml`, this workflow:
- Can be triggered manually with customizable options:
  - Option to send PDFs to Telegram
  - Option to include phone number
  - Option to use custom email instead of default emails
  - Custom email input field
- Creates a new GitHub release with the generated PDFs
- Tags releases with the current date (format: YYYY.MM.DD)
- Uploads PDFs as both artifacts and release assets
- Supports all features of the resume generation script

### Using the Workflows

1. For push-based builds:
   - Simply push changes to `src/main.typ`
   - The workflow will automatically trigger and generate PDFs

2. For manual releases:
   - Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository
   - Select "Create PDF Release"
   - Configure the desired options
   - Click "Run workflow"

The generated PDFs will be available as:
- Artifacts in the workflow run
- Release assets (for manual releases)
- In the `dist/` directory (which is git-ignored)
